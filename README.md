Basically yeah an excuse to fuck about a bit with [Spark](http://sparkjava.com), [OrmLite](http://ormlite.com/)
and [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/).

The aim is to produce a tiny maintainable JSON/REST framework that doesn't use Tomcat. Spark uses Jetty 
nice and transparently - all we've gotta do is build a bit of a project skeleton. By the way, it appears
someone's [already had a go at this](http://www.boxuk.com/blog/creating-rest-api-quickly-using-pure-java/)
with some success...

Basically yeah an excuse to fuck about a bit with [Spark](http://sparkjava.com), [OrmLite](http://ormlite.com/) and [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/).

The aim is to produce a tiny maintainable JSON/REST framework that

1. doesn't require Tomcat (or indeed any third-party software outside the Java deps); and
2. can be **poked** while it's running - not quite the same as "debugging" but hopefully good enough...

It turns out a guy called [Jon Morgan](https://twitter.com/h00zf1sh) over at [Box UK](http://www.boxuk.com) did the Spark/OrmLite POC back in 2014 - you can see his writeup [here](http://www.boxuk.com/blog/creating-rest-api-quickly-using-pure-java/).

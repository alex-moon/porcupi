Basically yeah an excuse to fuck about a bit with the [Spark Framework](http://sparkjava.com).

The aim is to produce a tiny maintainable JSON/REST service that doesn't use Tomcat. Spark
does REST its own way without Jackson so the whole thing might be a bit bogus but there's
only one way to find out.

Smashin it.

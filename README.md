Basically yeah an excuse to fuck about a bit with [Spark](http://sparkjava.com), [OrmLite](http://ormlite.com/)
and [GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/).

The aim is to produce a tiny maintainable JSON/REST framework that

1. doesn't require Tomcat (or indeed any third-party software outside the Java deps); and
2. can be **poked** while it's running - not quite the same as "debugging" but hopefully good enough...
